The deceived non local Means filter is part of the Deceived Weighted Averaging Filter Framework (DeWAFF), which defines an approach for image abstraction with a combination of Unsharp Masking for contrast and edges enhancement and weighted averaging filtering for noise reduction and texture simplification. The proposed methot uses integral images and the fast Fourier transform for the calculation of the Euclidian distance between the neighborhoods of each pixel in the sliding window to reduce the computational cost.

Our denoising algorithm is a rewriting of the recently proposed nonlocal mean filter. It builds on the separable property of neighborhood filtering to offer a fast parallel and vectorized implementation in contemporary shared memory computer architectures while reducing the theoretical computational complexity of the original filter. In practice, our approach is much faster than a serial, non–vectorized implementation and it scales linearly with image size. We demonstrate its efficiency in data sets from Caulobacter crescentus tomograms and a cryoimage containing viruses and provide visual evidences attesting the remarkable quality of the nonlocal means scheme in the context of cryoimaging. With such development we provide biologists with an attractive filtering tool to facilitate their scientific discoveries.},

@article{Goossens2008,
abstract = {Recently, the NLMeans filter has been proposed by Buades et al. for the suppression of white Gaussian noise. This filter exploits the repetitive character of structures in an image, unlike conventional denoising algorithms, which typically operate in a local neighbourhood. Even though the method is quite intuitive and potentially very powerful, the PSNR and visual results are somewhat infe-rior to other recent state-of-the-art non-local algorithms, like KSVD and BM-3D. In this paper, we show that the NLMeans algorithm is basically the first iteration of the Jacobi optimization algorithm for robustly estimating the noise-free image. Based on this insight, we present ad-ditional improvements to the NLMeans algorithm and also an extension to noise reduction of coloured (corre-lated) noise. For white noise, PSNR results show that the proposed method is very competitive with the BM-3D method, while the visual quality of our method is better due to the lower presence of artifacts. For correlated noise on the other hand, we obtain a significant improvement in denoising performance compared to recent wavelet-based techniques.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Non-local means filter is widely used for image noise reduction. Although the sequential implementation for this algorithm has been successfully applied to large scale InSAR problems, few parallel versions of the non-local InSAR filters have addressed well algorithm characteristics such as an unpredictable workload balance, a strong data dependency. These challenges engender many interesting design issues including domain decomposition, data access, management and workload balancing. This paper presents a sophisticated and improved parallel scheme for the iterative non-local Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) filters. The proposed algorithm gives a better speedup and high efficiency. Results for numerical simulations and performance measurements were obtained on SuperMUC.},

abstract = {The Non-local means denoising filter has been established as gold standard for image denoising problem in general and particularly in medical imaging due to its efficiency. However, its computation time limited its applications in real world application, especially in medical imaging. In this paper, a distributed version on parallel hybrid architecture is proposed to solve the computation time problem and a new method to compute the filters' coefficients is also proposed, where we focused on the implementation and the enhancement of filters' parameters via taking the neighborhood of the current voxel more accurately into account. In terms of implementation, our key contribution consists in reducing the number of shared memory accesses. The different tests of the proposed method were performed on the brain-web database for different levels of noise. Performances and the sensitivity were quantified in terms of speedup, peak signal to noise ratio, execution time, the number of floating point operations. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, the implementation is compared to that of other techniques, recently published in the literature.},

abstract = {The Non-Local means (NLM) denoising algorithm calculates similarity weight between denoising pixels and searching area pixels by establishing similar functions. In texture denoising and edge region denoising domain, the Non-Local Means denoising algorithm performs better than many other existing denoising algorithms because it uses the redundant information of images. However, NLM algorithm has defect in speed for the huge computational amount. Recently, Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor (based on Intel Many Integrated Core architecture, MIC) exhibits huge superiority in speedup computation. Therefore we design parallel algorithm strategies of OpenMP and OpenCL based on the serial NLM algorithm for MIC architecture, and conduct the experiment on CPU, GPU, and MIC with images of different sizes. The experiment suggests that the OpenMP-based NLM algorithm has better performance on Xeon Phi 7120 than on Xeon E5 2692 when the image size is greater than or equal to 1024*1024, the OpenCL-based NLM algorithm has better performance on Xeon Phi 7120 than on NVIDIA Kepler K20M GPU, and OpenCL-based NLM algorithm performs a little better than OpenMP-based NLM algorithm when they both implemented on Intel Xeon Phi 7120.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition is an important area of computer vision research. Its applications include surveillance systems, patient monitoring systems, and a variety of systems that involve interactions between persons and electronic devices such as human-computer interfaces. Most of these applications require an automated recognition of high-level activities, composed of multiple simple (or atomic) actions of persons. This article provides a detailed overview of various state-of-the-art research papers on human activity recognition. We discuss both the methodologies developed for simple human actions and those for high-level activities. An approach-based taxonomy is chosen that compares the advantages and limitations of each approach. Recognition methodologies for an analysis of the simple actions of a single person are first presented in the article. Space-time volume approaches and sequential approaches that represent and recognize activities directly from input images are discussed. Next, hierarchical recognition methodologies for high-level activities are presented and compared. Statistical approaches, syntactic approaches, and description-based approaches for hierarchical recognition are discussed in the article. In addition, we further discuss the papers on the recognition of human-object interactions and group activities. Public datasets designed for the evaluation of the recognition methodologies are illustrated in our article as well, comparing the methodologies' performances. This review will provide the impetus for future research in more productive areas.},

abstract = {We propose a fully automatic and computationally efficient framework for analysis and summarization of soccer videos using cinematic and object-based features. The proposed framework includes some novel low-level processing algorithms, such as dominant color region detection, robust shot boundary detection, and shot classification, as well as some higher-level algorithms for goal detection, referee detection, and penalty-box detection. The system can output three types of summaries: i) all slow-motion segments in a game; ii) all goals in a game; iii) slow-motion segments classified according to object-based features. The first two types of summaries are based on cinematic features only for speedy processing, while the summaries of the last type contain higher-level semantics. The proposed framework is efficient, effective, and robust. It is efficient in the sense that there is no need to compute object-based features when cinematic features are sufficient for the detection of certain events, e.g., goals in soccer. It is effective in the sense that the framework can also employ object-based features when needed to increase accuracy (at the expense of more computation). The efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed framework are demonstrated over a large data set, consisting of more than 13 hours of soccer video, captured in different countries and under different conditions.},

abstract = {Nonlocal-means (NL-means) is an image denoising method that replaces each pixel by a weighted average of all the pixels in the image. Unfortunately, the method requires the computation of the weighting terms for all possible pairs of pixels, making it computationally expensive. Some short-cuts assign a weight of zero to any pixel pairs whose neighbourhood averages are too dissimilar. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy that uses the SVD to more efficiently eliminate pixel pairs that are dissimilar. Experiments comparing this method against other NL-means speed-up strategies show that its refined discrimination between similar and dissimilar pixel neighbourhoods significantly improves the denoising effect.},

abstract = {We present an in-depth analysis of a variation of the nonlocal means (NLM) image denoising algorithm that uses principal component analysis (PCA) to achieve a higher accuracy while reducing computational load. Image neighborhood vectors are first projected onto a lower dimensional subspace using PCA. The dimensionality of this subspace is chosen automatically using parallel analysis. Consequently, neighborhood similarity weights for denoising are computed using distances in this subspace rather than the full space. The resulting algorithm is referred to as principal neighborhood dictionary (PND) nonlocal means. We investigate PND's accuracy as a function of the dimensionality of the projection subspace and demonstrate that denoising accuracy peaks at a relatively low number of dimensions. The accuracy of NLM and PND are also examined with respect to the choice of image neighborhood and search window sizes. Finally, we present a quantitative and qualitative comparison of PND versus NLM and another image neighborhood PCA-based state-of-the-art image denoising algorithm.},

@article{Chan2013,
abstract = {Non-local means (NLM) is a popular denoising scheme. Concep- tually simple, the algorithm is computationally intensive for large images. We propose to speed up NLM by using random sampling. Our algorithm picks, uniformly at random, a small number of columns of the weight matrix, and uses these “representatives” to compute an approximate result. It also incorporates an extra column- normalization of the sampled columns, a form of symmetrization that often boosts the denoising performance on real images. Using statistical large deviation theory, we analyze the proposed algorithm and provide guarantees on its performance. We show that the prob- ability of having a large approximation error decays exponentially as the image size increases. Thus, for large images, the random es- timates generated by the algorithm are tightly concentrated around their limit values, even if the sampling ratio is small. Numerical results confirm our theoretical analysis: the proposed algorithm re- duces the run time of NLM, and thanks to the symmetrization step, actually provides some improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratios.},

@inproceedings{Chatterjee2008,
abstract = {The Non-Local Means (NLM) method of denoising has received considerable attention in the image processing community due to its performance, despite its simplicity. In this paper, we show that NLM is a zero-th order kernel regression method, with a very specific choice of kernel. As such, it can be generalized. The original method of NLM, we show, implicitly assumes local constancy of the underlying image data. Once put in the context of kernel regression, we extend the existing Non-Local Means algorithm to higher orders of regression which allows us to approximate the image data locally by a polynomial or other localized basis of a given order. These extra degrees of freedom allow us to perform better denoising in texture regions. Overall the higher order method displays consistently better denoising capabilities compared to the zero-th order method. The power of the higher order method is amply illustrated with the help of various denoising experiments.},

abstract = {— We propose stochastic bilateral filter (SBF) and sto-chastic non-local means (SNLM), efficient randomized processes that agree with conventional bilateral filter (BF) and non-local means (NLM) on average, respectively. By Monte-Carlo, we repeat this process a few times with different random instantia-tions so that they can be averaged to attain the correct BF/NLM output. The computational bottleneck of the SBF and SNLM are constant with respect to the window size and the color dimension of the edge image, meaning the execution times for color and hyperspectral images are nearly the same as for the grayscale images. In addition, for SNLM, the complexity is constant with respect to the block size. The proposed stochastic filter implementations are considerably faster than the conventional and existing " fast " implementations for high dimensional image data.},

abstract = {For the non-local denoising approach presented by Buades et al., remarkable denoising results are obtained at high expense of computational cost. In this paper, a new algorithm that re-duces the computational cost for calculating the similarity of neighborhood windows is proposed. We first introduce an ap-proximate measure about the similarity of neighborhood win-dows, then we use an efficient Summed Square Image (SSI) scheme and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to accelerate the calculation of this measure. Our algorithm is about fifty times faster than the original non-local algorithm both theoretically and experimentally, yet produces comparable results in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and perceptual image quality.},

Patch clustering it is proposed to guide the selection of the best patches to be used to filter each pixel. Besides clustering, we incorporate spatial coherence keeping some local patches extracted from a local search window around each pixel. Therefore, for each pixel we use local patches and non local ones extracted from the corresponding cluster. The proposed method outperforms classical Non Local Means filter and also, when compared with other methods from the literature based on random sampling, our results confirm the benefits of sampling inside clusters combined with local information.},

It provides a significant increase in scalar and vector performance and a big boost in memory bandwidth compared to the prior generation, called Knights Corner. Knights Landing is a self-booting, standard CPU that is completely binary compatible with prior Intel Xeon processors and is capable of running all legacy workloads unmodified. Its innovations include a core optimized for power efficiency, a 512-bit vector instruction set, a memory architecture comprising two types of memory for high bandwidth and large capacity, a high-bandwidth on-die interconnect, and an integrated on-package network fabric. These features enable the Knights Landing processor to provide significant performance improvement for computationally intensive and bandwidth-bound workloads while still providing good performance on unoptimized legacy workloads, without requiring any special way of programming other than the standard CPU programming model.},
