abstract = {Human activity recognition is an important area of computer vision research. Its applications include surveillance systems, patient monitoring systems, and a variety of systems that involve interactions between persons and electronic devices such as human-computer interfaces. Most of these applications require an automated recognition of high-level activities, composed of multiple simple (or atomic) actions of persons. This article provides a detailed overview of various state-of-the-art research papers on human activity recognition. We discuss both the methodologies developed for simple human actions and those for high-level activities. An approach-based taxonomy is chosen that compares the advantages and limitations of each approach. Recognition methodologies for an analysis of the simple actions of a single person are first presented in the article. Space-time volume approaches and sequential approaches that represent and recognize activities directly from input images are discussed. Next, hierarchical recognition methodologies for high-level activities are presented and compared. Statistical approaches, syntactic approaches, and description-based approaches for hierarchical recognition are discussed in the article. In addition, we further discuss the papers on the recognition of human-object interactions and group activities. Public datasets designed for the evaluation of the recognition methodologies are illustrated in our article as well, comparing the methodologies' performances. This review will provide the impetus for future research in more productive areas.},

The proposed framework includes some novel low-level processing algorithms, such as dominant color region detection, robust shot boundary detection, and shot classification, as well as some higher-level algorithms for goal detection, referee detection, and penalty-box detection. The system can output three types of summaries: i) all slow-motion segments in a game; ii) all goals in a game; iii) slow-motion segments classified according to object-based features. The first two types of summaries are based on cinematic features only for speedy processing, while the summaries of the last type contain higher-level semantics. The proposed framework is efficient, effective, and robust. It is efficient in the sense that there is no need to compute object-based features when cinematic features are sufficient for the detection of certain events, e.g., goals in soccer. It is effective in the sense that the framework can also employ object-based features when needed to increase accuracy (at the expense of more computation). The efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed framework are demonstrated over a large data set, consisting of more than 13 hours of soccer video, captured in different countries and under different conditions.},

abstract = {Nonlocal-means (NL-means) is an image denoising method that replaces each pixel by a weighted average of all the pixels in the image. Unfortunately, the method requires the computation of the weighting terms for all possible pairs of pixels, making it computationally expensive. Some short-cuts assign a weight of zero to any pixel pairs whose neighbourhood averages are too dissimilar. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy that uses the SVD to more efficiently eliminate pixel pairs that are dissimilar. Experiments comparing this method against other NL-means speed-up strategies show that its refined discrimination between similar and dissimilar pixel neighbourhoods significantly improves the denoising effect.},

abstract = {We present an in-depth analysis of a variation of the nonlocal means (NLM) image denoising algorithm that uses principal component analysis (PCA) to achieve a higher accuracy while reducing computational load. Image neighborhood vectors are first projected onto a lower dimensional subspace using PCA. The dimensionality of this subspace is chosen automatically using parallel analysis. Consequently, neighborhood similarity weights for denoising are computed using distances in this subspace rather than the full space. The resulting algorithm is referred to as principal neighborhood dictionary (PND) nonlocal means. We investigate PND's accuracy as a function of the dimensionality of the projection subspace and demonstrate that denoising accuracy peaks at a relatively low number of dimensions. The accuracy of NLM and PND are also examined with respect to the choice of image neighborhood and search window sizes. Finally, we present a quantitative and qualitative comparison of PND versus NLM and another image neighborhood PCA-based state-of-the-art image denoising algorithm.},

abstract = {Non-local means (NLM) is a popular denoising scheme. Concep- tually simple, the algorithm is computationally intensive for large images. We propose to speed up NLM by using random sampling. Our algorithm picks, uniformly at random, a small number of columns of the weight matrix, and uses these “representatives” to compute an approximate result. It also incorporates an extra column- normalization of the sampled columns, a form of symmetrization that often boosts the denoising performance on real images. Using statistical large deviation theory, we analyze the proposed algorithm and provide guarantees on its performance. We show that the prob- ability of having a large approximation error decays exponentially as the image size increases. Thus, for large images, the random es- timates generated by the algorithm are tightly concentrated around their limit values, even if the sampling ratio is small. Numerical results confirm our theoretical analysis: the proposed algorithm re- duces the run time of NLM, and thanks to the symmetrization step, actually provides some improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratios.},
